            <h2>How we made our 3rd prototype:</h2>
            <p>The first step we did was reverse engineer a finger pulse monitor.<br>The second step was to get all the pieces together and sketch them.</p>

                </picture>
            <p>The third step was to assemble the pieces together and make a cardboard prototype.</p>

                </picture>
            <p>The fourth step was to add some moving components to the prototype.<br>The fifth step was we bought the pieces we needed and started assembling the project.<br>Sadly, we didnt have all of the parts and it would take too long ot order the exact ones we needed.<br>Instead, we found alternative components online that all came last minute with Amazon Prime.</p>
            <p>The Sixth step was getting the working prototype.<br>The seventh step was coding the heart rate monitor to make sure the display screen turned on.<br>The eighth step was making sure the pulse sensor measured the correct pulse of a human when putting their finger on the scanner.<br>The ninth step was checking to make sure the data is correct and make sure it is able to locate a pulse.<br>The tenth step was putting our finger on the scanner and make sure it works correctly.</p>
